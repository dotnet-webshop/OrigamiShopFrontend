A customer can create a new account in the web shop.
This will make things easier for the customer to add some products to the shopping cart
while editing or deleting a certain product in the cart. The customer also is able to view the order history
as well as editing or deleting their own profile.

An Admin on the other hand is able to create, edit and delete products and customers as well as handling orders.
